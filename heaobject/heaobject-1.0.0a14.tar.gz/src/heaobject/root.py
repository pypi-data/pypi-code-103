class HEAObject(abc.ABC):
    """
    Interface for all HEA objects. HEA objects are data transfer objects for moving data between HEA microservices as
    well as between a HEA microservice and a web browser or other client. HEA objects have no behavior except support
    for storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization. The AbstractHEAObject class provides default
    implementations for setting and getting attributes, as well as default implementations of behaviors.

    There are two sub-types of HEA objects: desktop objects (DesktopObject) and owned
    objects (MemberObject). The AbstractDesktopObject and AbstractMemberObject classes provide default implementations
    for setting and getting attributes, and default implementations of behaviors. There may be additional sub-types in
    the future.

    Desktop objects represent objects that appear on the HEA desktop. Desktop objects have permissions, timestamps for
    when the object was created and modified, versions, and more. One or more HEA microservices provide CRUD (create,
    read, update, and delete) operations on each desktop object type. Additional HEA microservices may implement actions
    that consume or produce specific desktop object types.

    Member objects cannot appear by themselves on the HEA desktop. Instead, they have a part-of relationship with a
    desktop object, and their lifecycle is managed by the desktop object. Example member objects represent permissions
    and data sharing. While owned objects provide for their own storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization,
    these behaviors are always invoked by the desktop object of which they are a part. HEA objects may contain only one
    level of nested members.

    HEA objects must conform to several conventions to ease their use and reuse across the HEA desktop.
    All subclasses of HEAObject must have a zero-argument constructor. Attribute values may be strings, numbers, booleans,
    enums, or a HEA object; or a list of strings, numbers, booleans, enums, or HEA objects. Attributes of type enum
    must be implemented as a property with a setter that accepts both strings and the enum values, and will convert the
    strings to enum values.

    In general, HEA objects implement composition relationships by making the container a desktop object and the "owned"
    object a member object. Other association relationships are implemented by storing the id of the associated object
    rather than nesting it. By convention, the id attributes are named hea_object_class_name_id, where hea_object_class_name
    is the name of the class converted from camel case to underscores. There is one exception to this convention in the
    heaobject library. Item objects contain a nested copy of the desktop object that they refer to.

    Copies and deep copies using the copy module will copy all non-callable instance members of any subclass of HEAObject.

    In addition, HEA objects should include type annotations throughout.

    It is imperative that users gain access to desktop objects by calling an appropriate HEA microservice as themselves, which
    will filter any nested member objects that are returned according to their permissions.
