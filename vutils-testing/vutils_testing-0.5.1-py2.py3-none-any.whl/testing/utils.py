    This function becomes handy when creating types used as test data. For

class LazyInstance:
    r"""
    Support lazy initialization.

    Object is constructed/initialized at time when its member function is
    called. Example::

        foo_factory = LazyInstance(Foo, initialize_once=False)
        foo = foo_factory.create(1, bar=2)
        test(foo.quux)

    when ``test`` calls ``foo.quux``, ``Foo(1, bar=2)`` is invoked first
    to make the instance of ``Foo`` and to cache the instance inside
    ``foo_factory``. Then, from this instance, ``quux`` is invoked. Since
    ``foo_factory`` was created with *initialize_once* property set to `False`,
    ``foo`` is initialized every time when ``foo.quux`` is invoked.

    The story behind `LazyInstance`: consider the following snippet of code::

        class Foo:
            def __init__(self):
                self.stream = sys.stderr

            def greet(self):
                self.stream.write("Hello!\n")


        def test(func, mystream):
            # Replace sys.stderr for mystream:
            with SysStderrPatcher(mystream).patch():
                func()

    in this scenario::

        mystream = io.StringIO()
        foo = Foo()
        test(foo.greet, mystream)

    ``Hello!\n`` will be send to `sys.stderr` since the patching has been done
    too late. This is where `LazyInstance` comes to help us::

        mystream = io.StringIO()
        foo_factory = LazyInstance(Foo)
        foo = foo_factory.create()
        test(foo.greet, mystream)

    now,  ``Hello!\n`` is written to ``mystream`` as expected.
